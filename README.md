# Quiz Whiz

*Quiz Whiz* is an engaging kids' game designed to promote digital wellbeing by allowing users to create their own topics, questions, and answers, and then play these questions in a fun flashcard format. This project was developed as part of a group software development assignment at QUT, consisting of a team of five individuals. My primary contributions focused on the frontend and game development aspects.
